<h2>Declaring methods</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p><a href="/learn/step/10973" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Built-in methods</a> are a real deal when you manage routine tasks. Still, they are not a cure-all solution since it's impossible to provide a standard method for each specific task. For example, you may need to convert dollars to euros, count your monthly spending, or even calculate a daily portion of seeds for your parrot multiple times. That's when you create your own method to avoid repeating tons of code!</p>
<p>In contrast to <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/10973" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, built-in methods are pre-defined functions that are always available to the user, belonging to the standard Java library. | They are used to perform various operations such as converting or comparing values, rounding doubles, finding maximum or minimum values, and more. Built-in methods are part of the Java library, and there are many of them that can be found in the Oracle documentation. They are useful for managing routine tasks, but they are not a cure-all solution as it is impossible to provide a standard method for each specific task.">built-in methods</a>, <strong>user-defined</strong> methods are created by the programmer.

<p>Technically, a method is just a structured part of code with a few components. Let's take a closer look at a method that calculates a daily portion of seeds for a parrot:</p>

<p>A method contains a<strong> set of modifiers</strong>, a <strong>type of the return value</strong>, a <strong>name</strong>,<strong> </strong>a list of <a href="/learn/step/10973" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>parameters</strong></a> in <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3519" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="They can be used in method declarations and definitions to define the method's parameter list. | Parentheses are also used in expressions to specify the order of operations. The order of operations in Java follows the standard arithmetic rules, where multiplication and division have a higher priority level than addition and subtraction. However, parentheses can be used to override this priority and specify the order in which operations are performed. For example, in the expression (5 + 10) * 3, the addition is performed first due to the parentheses, and then the result is multiplied by 3. Parentheses can be nested, meaning that they can contain other parentheses, which can be useful for specifying complex expressions.">parentheses</a> <code class="language-java">()</code> , and a <a href="/learn/step/3521" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>body</strong></a> in curly brackets <code class="language-java">{}</code>. The combination of the name of the method and the list of its parameters is known as a method <strong>signature</strong>. In our example, the signature is <code class="language-java">countSeeds(int, int)</code>.</p>
<p>Some methods also have a list of <a href="/learn/step/3497" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">exceptions</a> — they define the method's behavior in case of a mistake in the program. If during the execution of a method, one of its exceptions is thrown, the exception is handled outside the method. For now, we'll consider simple methods without exceptions.</p>
<p>Let's focus on the main components that we need to write simple methods from scratch.</p>
<h5 id="name-of-the-method">Name of the method</h5>
<p>Each method has a name that is used to call it. Generally, it reflects what the method does – prints, finds, calculates, and provides you with some information.</p>
<p>The Java compiler requires a <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a method name is an identifier that is used to uniquely identify a method within a class. | It is specified during the method declaration and is used to call or invoke the method. The method name, along with its parameter list in parentheses, forms the method signature. Method names should be descriptive and follow the naming conventions of starting with a lowercase letter and using camelCase for multiple words. They can include letters, digits, and the underscore character, but cannot start with a digit. A method name is a legal identifier in Java.">method name</a> to be a <a href="/learn/step/10545" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>legal identifier</strong></a>. The rules for <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a legal identifier is a unique name given to an entity such as a variable, method, class, or any other user-defined entity to distinguish it from others. | An identifier can consist of letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs, but they cannot begin with a digit. Java is case-sensitive, so uppercase and lowercase letters are treated as distinct characters. It is important to choose meaningful and descriptive names for identifiers to make the code more readable and maintainable. Identifiers can include Unicode letters, digits, underscores, or currency characters, but they must not be a keyword. Additionally, there is a naming convention that restricts possible method names. It's optional but desired for developers to follow this convention.">legal identifiers</a> are the following:</p>
<ul><li><p>identifiers are case-sensitive;</p></li><li><p>an identifier can include Unicode letters, digits, <a href="/learn/step/10545" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">underscore</a> <code class="language-java">_</code> or currency <a href="/learn/step/3522" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">characters</a>, such as <code class="language-java">$</code>;</p></li><li><p>an identifier can't start with a digit;</p></li><li><p>identifiers must not be a keyword.</p></li></ul>
<p>In addition, there is a <a href="/learn/step/3513" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">naming convention</a> that restricts possible method names. It's optional but desired for developers. By convention, a one-word name should be a verb in lowercase: <code class="language-java">sum</code>, <code class="language-java">multiply</code>, or <code class="language-java">round</code>. On the contrary, such names as <code class="language-java">recorded</code>, <code class="language-java">students</code> or <code class="language-java">highest</code> do not comply with the convention.</p>
<p>If a method has a multi-word name, the first letter of the second and the following words should be capitalized: <code class="language-java">getValue</code>, <code class="language-java">calculateNumberOfOranges</code>, or <code class="language-java">findLetter</code>.</p>
<h5 id="modifiers">Modifiers</h5>
<p>The first words are so-<a href="/learn/step/10973" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">called</a> modifiers. There are two types of modifiers in Java: <strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3589" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, access modifiers are special keywords that specify who is allowed to use your code or a part of it. | They can be placed in front of any field, method, or class. There are four different access modifiers in Java: private, package-private (also known as default), protected, and public. The private access modifier is only accessible within the class itself. The package-private access modifier is accessible to classes from the same package. The protected access modifier is accessible to classes from the same package and any extending class. The public access modifier can be accessed from anywhere.">access modifiers</a></strong> and <a href="/learn/step/3589" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>non-access modifiers</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Access modifiers define the <a href="/learn/step/3610" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">visibility</a> of the method. For now, we're using a <code class="language-java">public</code> access modifier, which means there are no restrictions for <a href="/learn/step/7762" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">invoking</a> the method from anywhere.</p>
<p>Non-access modifiers<strong> </strong>provide information about the behavior of methods to JVM. The modifier <code class="language-java">static</code> means that the method belongs to the <a href="/learn/step/19918" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">class</a> and it can be accessed without creating any <a href="/learn/step/4727" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">object</a>. This type of method is called a <a href="/learn/step/3495" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>static method</strong></a>.</p>
<p>If the method is declared without the <code class="language-java">static</code> modifier, it means that the method can be invoked only through or with an object or instance of this class. Such methods are called <a href="/learn/step/3495" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>instance methods</strong></a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-primary"><p></p><p></p><p>Remember that there is a recommended order for the modifiers that you can find in the <a href="https://rules.sonarsource.com/java/tag/convention/RSPEC-1124" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Java Language Specification</a>. In our case, it is <code class="language-java">public static</code>.</p><p></p><p></p></div>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h5 id="method-parameters">Method parameters</h5>
<p>In parentheses after the method name, we define the type, number, and order of the parameters. This reflects how they will be passed to the method when it is invoked. Take a look at these signatures:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">convertEurosToDollars(double dlrRate, long eur);

countMonthlySpendings(long food, long rent, long fun); 

replace(char a, char b);
</code></pre>
<p>As you know, there are also methods that don't have values passed to them. These methods are known as <em>non-parameterized</em>.</p>
<h5 id="body-and-return-statement">Body and return statement</h5>
<p>Before a method completes its execution and exits, it returns a value known as a <a href="/learn/step/34572" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>return value</strong></a>. The <a href="/learn/step/9955" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">result</a> of your method execution can be a value of primitive<strong> </strong>types like <code class="language-java">int</code>, <code class="language-java">float</code>, <code class="language-java">double</code>, <code class="language-java">boolean</code>, or reference<strong> </strong>types like <code class="language-java">String</code>. Take a look at our <code class="language-java">countSeeds</code> method with the <a href="/learn/step/3539" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">return type</a> <code class="language-java">int</code>:</p>

<p>What you see inside the curly brackets is known as the <strong>body</strong> of the method. The body holds the logic we want to implement by our method: a set of statements to perform with the passed values to obtain the result. Our method <code class="language-java">countSeeds</code> takes two provided values, performs certain calculations, and returns the result within a <a href="/learn/step/13775" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>return statement</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Methods do not necessarily have to return a value. If we want a method not to return a value but to perform <a href="/learn/step/3582" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">operations</a> only, the <a href="/learn/step/3521" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">keyword</a> <code class="language-java">void</code> is used as a <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a return type is the data type of the value returned by a method. | Methods can return various types of data, such as integers, strings, or objects, depending on their implementation. If a method does not return a value, its return type is specified as void. When a method is called, the returned value can be assigned to a variable, printed, or passed as an argument to another method. Java also supports covariant return types, which allow a subclass to narrow the return type of an overridden method to a subtype of the original return type.">return type</a>. Take a look at <code class="language-java">printSeedsCount</code> method:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">// the following method just prints the line, so it returns no value
public static void printSeedsCount(int seeds) {
    System.out.println("Give your parrot " + seeds + "g of seeds per day");
}</code></pre>
<p>When this method is called it <a href="/learn/step/13775" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">prints</a> the line with recommendations on feeding the parrot and does not allow us to keep a value. Note that there is no <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a return statement is a statement that ends the execution of a method and specifies a value to be returned to the point from which the method was called. | A method does not necessarily have to return a value, and if a method does not return a value, its return type is specified as void. However, even if a method has a void return type, a return statement can still be used to exit the method, especially if it contains conditions.">return statement</a>.</p>
<p>Though methods with a <code class="language-java">void</code> return type return nothing, you still may use a <code class="language-java">return</code> word to exit the method. Usually, this applies to methods with <a href="/learn/step/3582" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">conditions</a>. Take a look:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public static void isPositive(int num) {
	if (num &gt; 0) {
		System.out.println("the number is positive");
	} else {
		return;
	}
}

<h5 id="what-happens-when-we-invoke-a-method">What happens when we invoke a method</h5>
<p>When invoking a method, we can write the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a return value is the result that a method gives after executing its logic. | A method can return a value of a specific data type, or it can return no value, using the void keyword. If a method has a return type, it must include a return statement to provide the result. When invoking a method that returns a value, you can store it in a variable, print it, or pass it as an argument to another method.">returned value</a> to some variable, print it out, or pass it on to another method. This is how it looks in a program:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public class Main {
    public static int countSeeds(int parrotWeight, int parrotAge) {
        return parrotWeight / 5 + parrotAge; // it returns an int
    }

    public static void printSeedsCount(int seeds) {
        System.out.println("Give your parrot " + seeds + "g of seeds per day");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int myParrotWeight = 100;
        int myParrotAge = 3;

        /**
         * Now myParrotPortion equals 23
         * because our method countSeeds, as described above, 
         * calculates parrotWeight / 5 + parrotAge
         */ 
        int myParrotPortion = countSeeds(myParrotWeight, myParrotAge);
        printSeedsCount(myParrotPortion);
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>If we execute the program above the output will be as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Give your parrot 23g of seeds per day</code></pre>
<p>There's another important thing to remember. When you pass a <a href="/learn/step/3518" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">variable</a> of a <a href="/learn/step/3532" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">primitive type</a> to a method, a copy of this <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3518" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a variable is a named storage location that is used to store a value of a specific type. | It is declared with a specific data type, which determines the kind of value that can be stored in it. Every variable has a unique name, also known as an identifier, which is used to access its value. Variables can be declared and initialized in a single statement, and their value can be accessed and modified using the name. It's important to note that variables can be changed, meaning you can assign a new value to a variable without having to declare it again.">variable</a> is created with the same value. Inside a method, only this copy is processed. Any changes to this copy will not affect the variable that was passed.</p>
<p>Take a look:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public class Main {
    public static int countSeeds(int parrotWeight, int parrotAge) {
        return parrotWeight / 5 + parrotAge; // it returns an int
    }

    public static void printSeedsCount(int seeds) {
        System.out.println("Give your parrot " + seeds + "g of seeds per day");
    }

    /**
     * The method increases the portion of seeds by 50 
     * and prints the resulting value
     */ 
    public static void addSeeds(int portion) {
        portion += 50;
        System.out.println("The increased portion is " + portion); 
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int myParrotWeight = 100;
        int myParrotAge = 3;

        int myParrotPortion = countSeeds(myParrotWeight, myParrotAge);
        addSeeds(myParrotPortion); // try to change portion 
        // now let's print a portion
        printSeedsCount(myParrotPortion);
        // 100, because the method didn't change portion, only its copy
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>The output will look like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">The increased portion is 73
Give your parrot 23g of seeds per day</code></pre>
<p>Although the <code class="language-java">addSeeds</code> method changes the passed <a href="/learn/step/12877" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">argument</a>, it happens to a different variable with its own value, leaving the value of the original <code class="language-java">portion</code> variable intact.</p>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>As you see, a method is a <a href="/learn/step/3533" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">block</a> of code that contains a set of modifiers, a return type, a name, a list of its parameters, and a body. A method may return a value or return nothing, which is indicated with the <code class="language-java">void</code> keyword.</p>
<p>If you know the syntax of methods, you can create your own and adjust them for your needs. This practice will make your code more structured and reusable.</p>
